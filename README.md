# TODO (if I had more time):

- [ ] Reformat html in react files
- [ ] Put more time into naming css classes/ids
- [ ] Move settings handling from Configurator to Settings component
- [ ] Run linters and fix warnings
- [ ] Use redux-thunk

# Not finished: 
- Modal with door type info
- My organization fetch
- Share component

Idea behind 'share' functionality was a component which takes get parameters from url, creates an configuration object, Redirects to Configurator component with passed configuration object.

And 'SHARE' button would return built url for sharing.
